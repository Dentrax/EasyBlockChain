## About

EasyBlockChain was created to serve three purposes:

**EasyBlockChain is a basically Block-Chain-Technology learning repository**

1. To act as a guide to learn Block-Chain with enhanced and rich content using `C++`.

2. To act as a guide to exemplary and educational purpose.

3. To create your own Block-Chain.
